/**
 * This is a stripped down version of the android media player that makes a few assumptions:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>The underlying media activePlayer is always either playing or released. There is never
 *     a state where the media activePlayer is created, but not playing anything.</li>
 *     <li>The media activePlayer can be released as soon as a single sound action or set of sound actions
 *     are complete. There is no pausing, and as soon as a sound is finished or interrupted, the activePlayer
 *     can be released immediately.</li>
 *     <li>The media activePlayer is playing sounds based on a packaged resource ID</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Created by Sam on 2017-07-29.
 * @deprecated This implementation works, but has problems with latency when fast-switching between
 * tracks. Consider using {@link SoundPoolMediaProvider} instead.
